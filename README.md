# Chrome Enterprise Premium MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server for
[Chrome Enterprise Premium](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise-premium/docs/overview)
(CEP). CEP extends Chrome's built-in security with Data Loss Prevention (DLP),
real-time threat protection (phishing and malware scanning), and Context-Aware
Access controls. This server exposes CEP's DLP rules, content detectors,
connector policies, browser telemetry, and license management as MCP tools —
letting any MCP-compatible AI agent inspect and configure a Chrome Enterprise
environment.

## Important security consideration: Indirect Prompt Injection Risk

When exposing any language model to untrusted data, there's a risk of an
[indirect prompt injection attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection).
Agentic tools like Gemini CLI, connected to MCP servers, have access to a wide
array of tools and APIs.

This MCP server grants the agent the ability to read, modify, and delete your
Google Account data, as well as other data shared with you.

- Never connect this server to untrusted tools.
- Never feed untrusted content into the model context, including mail,
  documents, or other resources from unverified sources.
- Attackers can hide instructions inside untrusted content and use a
  hijacked CLI session to modify, steal, or destroy your data.
- Always review the actions Gemini CLI takes on your behalf and confirm
  they match what you asked for.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp.git
cd chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp
npm install
```

### 1. Authenticate with Google Cloud

Install the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) if you
don't have it, then create
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)
(ADC) with the scopes needed by each API:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
--scopes=openid,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chrome.management.policy,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chrome.management.reports.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chrome.management.profiles.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.customer.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.licensing,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.policies,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
```

These scopes map to the underlying APIs:

| Scope                                                                 | API                                                                             | Used for                                                           |

| `admin.directory.orgunit.readonly`                                    | [Admin SDK Directory](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory)        | Organizational unit hierarchy                                      |
| `admin.directory.customer.readonly`                                   | [Admin SDK Directory](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory)        | Customer ID resolution                                             |
| `apps.licensing`                                                      | [Enterprise License Manager](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/licensing) | CEP subscription and per-user license checks                       |
| `cloud-identity.policies`                                             | [Cloud Identity](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs)                        | DLP rules and content detectors (CRUD)                             |

Then set a quota project (identifies which GCP project's API enablement and
quotas to use):

```bash
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

> **Scopes must be provided at login time.** You cannot add scopes to
> existing ADC credentials. If you get "insufficient scopes" errors,
> delete `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` and re-run
> the login command above.
>
> **The quota project is required.** Without it you'll see a "quota project
> not set" error on the first API call.
>
> **Restricted Workspace environments:** If your organization restricts third-party
> app access, an admin must [trust the gcloud OAuth app](docs/troubleshooting.md#configure-oauth-app-for-sensitive-scopes)
> before you can authenticate with sensitive Workspace scopes.

### 2. Enable Required APIs

These APIs must be enabled on your GCP project:

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  admin.googleapis.com \
  chromemanagement.googleapis.com \
  chromepolicy.googleapis.com \
  cloudidentity.googleapis.com \
  licensing.googleapis.com \
  serviceusage.googleapis.com
```

Or enable them from the
[API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in Cloud Console.

> **Propagation delay:** Newly enabled APIs can take 1–5 minutes to become
> available. The server handles this automatically by retrying
> `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors with exponential backoff. If you see retry messages
> on first run, wait; don't restart.

### 3. Connect Your MCP Client

The server uses **stdio** transport; your MCP client launches it as a child
process. Add the config snippet for your client:

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest"],
      "env": { "GCP_STDIO": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest"],
      "env": { "GCP_STDIO": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code</strong></summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest"],
      "env": { "GCP_STDIO": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest"],
      "env": { "GCP_STDIO": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

> (Optional) If you are running from a local checkout instead of npx, replace the command with `node` and args with the absolute path to `mcp-server.js`. Relative paths may not resolve correctly depending on the client.

### 4. Verify

Restart your MCP client, then ask:

> "What Chrome Enterprise Premium tools do you have access to?"

You should see the agent discover and list the available tools. If tools don't
appear, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Configuration

For environment variables and stdio vs. HTTP transport, see
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

## Prerequisites

## Available Tools and Prompts

### Prompts

| Prompt         | Description                                                                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cep:health`   | Health check of the Chrome Enterprise environment (APIs, DLP, connectors, extensions). |
| `cep:optimize` | Rule-by-rule review with tuning, enforcement, and cleanup recommendations.             |
| `cep:expert`   | Manually re-injects the expert persona and rules (useful if the agent loses context).  |

### Tools

The server exposes tools for reading and managing Chrome Enterprise resources:

- **Discovery:** get customer ID, list org units, count browser versions, list
  customer profiles
- **Licensing:** check CEP subscription status, check per-user license
  assignment
- **DLP:** list/create/delete DLP rules, list/create/delete detectors (regex,
  word list, URL list), create default rule sets
- **Connectors:** get connector policy status, enable Chrome Enterprise
  connectors
- **Extensions:** check SEB extension status, install SEB extension
- **Security:** get Chrome activity logs, check and enable required APIs
- **Knowledge:** search the built-in Chrome Enterprise Premium knowledge base

## Architecture

The codebase has three layers: API clients in `lib/api/` (one interface +
real implementation per Google API), MCP tools and prompts in `tools/` and
`prompts/`, and the server entry point in `mcp-server.js`. Integration tests
redirect the real API clients at an in-process Express fake under
`test/helpers/`. For the directory layout, design patterns, and how the test
backends are wired, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Development

Run `npm run presubmit` before every PR. It runs unit tests, fake-backend
integration tests, and a smoke test against the in-process fake API server;
no credentials needed. After merge, `npm run postsubmit` re-runs the full
presubmit suite plus a real-API integration pass.

Presubmit is **read-only**. If formatting or lint fails, run
`npm run format` and `npm run lint:fix` to fix, then re-run. The husky
pre-commit hook auto-fixes staged files via lint-staged, so commits from a
clean working tree usually pass without manual fixup.

GitHub Actions runs the same checks on every pull request as four parallel
jobs (`lint`, `test-unit`, `test-integration-fake`, `test-smoke`); each
failure shows up as a separate PR check. The workflow is at
[`.github/workflows/node.js.yml`](.github/workflows/node.js.yml).

```bash
npm run presubmit               # Required before every PR
npm run postsubmit              # After merge (real API credentials)
npm run test:unit               # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration:fake   # Integration tests against the fake
npm run test:smoke              # Server starts and responds
npm run mcp-inspector           # Browser UI for invoking tools and prompts
npm run lint                    # Check formatting and lint
npm run lint -- --fix           # Auto-fix
npm run format                  # Prettier on everything
```

integration (including the `/mcp` reload tip when CEP tools do not show up
right after restart), see
[`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## FAQ

For license requirements, Workspace edition, service-account auth,
experimental features, and other recurring questions, see
[`docs/faq.md`](docs/faq.md).

## Reporting Bugs

If something isn't working:

1. In Gemini CLI, run `/bug` to capture session diagnostics. Attach the
   generated file to your issue.
2. Run `npm run presubmit` and paste the output; this lets maintainers tell
   environmental problems from real code bugs.
3. Describe what you expected vs. what actually happened, including the exact
   error message.
