# test

We split tests across four directories by what each tier needs at runtime
(network access, MCP harness, real Google APIs).

## Test tiers

**`local/`** — Primary suite. Tests in this directory run without network
access, against in-process fakes or pure unit logic, covering the API
clients, tool behavior, CEL validation, auth, prompts, server lifecycle,
and the eval infrastructure itself. Most new tests go here.

**`unit/`** — Isolated unit tests for feature flags and connector
enablement. They exercise pure functions directly without the MCP harness.

**`integration/`** — End-to-end tests that exercise tools through the full MCP
client/server harness. The `tools/` subdirectory contains lifecycle tests (rule
CRUD, detector CRUD, connector enablement) that run against both fake and real
API backends.

**`evals/`** — LLM-as-judge evaluation suite. Sends natural language prompts to
a Gemini-powered agent, grades responses on factual accuracy and tool usage. Has
its own [README](evals/README.md).

## Test infrastructure (`helpers/`)

- `fake-api-server.js` — Express app that simulates all five Google APIs
  in-process. Serves canned responses, tracks mutations, and resets state
  between tests.
- `integration/tools/harness.js` — Sets up a full MCP client/server pair with
  fake or real API clients. Provides `callTool()` helper for integration tests.
- `integration/tools/client_factory.js` — Creates the appropriate API client set
  (fake or real) based on `CEP_BACKEND` env var.

## Runner scripts

| Script                    | npm command                     | What it runs                               |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `run-unit.js`             | `npm run test:unit`             | `unit/` tests                              |
| `run-all.js`              | `npm test`                      | Unit + smoke                               |
| `run-integration.js`      | `npm run test:integration:fake` | Integration tests against fake backend     |
| `run-integration.js real` | `npm run test:integration:real` | Integration tests against live Google APIs |

**Composite scripts:**

- `npm run presubmit` — unit + fake integration + smoke. Run before submitting.
- `npm run postsubmit` — presubmit + real API integration. Run after merge.
- `npm run test:smoke` — Quick check that the server starts and responds.

## Adding a new test

Most new tests go in `local/`. If your test needs the full MCP harness (client ↔
server ↔ API clients), add it in `integration/tools/`. If you're testing a new
API endpoint, add the route to `helpers/fake-api-server.js` first.

Test files use Node's built-in `node:test` runner and `node:assert`. No external
test framework.
