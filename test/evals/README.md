# CEP MCP Server Evals

This directory contains the evaluation suite for the Chrome Enterprise Premium
MCP server. Evals verify that the AI agent -- which wraps our MCP tools and
presents them to end users -- behaves correctly: calling the right tools,
producing accurate responses, and never leaking internal implementation details.

## What evals test

Unit and integration tests (in `test/local/` and `test/integration/tools/`)
cover deterministic behavior: "call `create_chrome_dlp_rule` with these args,
get this response." Evals cover the layer above: what happens when an LLM agent
decides which tools to call and how to present results to a user.

Each eval sends a natural language prompt to a Gemini-powered agent with access
to all MCP tools. The agent decides which tools to call, executes them against a
fake API backend, and produces a response. That response is graded on two axes:

1. **Deterministic checks** -- objective, instant, no LLM involved
2. **LLM-as-judge** -- semantic quality assessment via Gemini

Both must pass for an eval to pass.

## Architecture

```text
test/evals/
  run.js              CLI entry point
  global.yaml         Global forbidden patterns + default judge rubric
  TEMPLATE.eval.js    Starter template for new cases
  lib/
    loader.js          Loads .eval.js cases (and remaining legacy .md cases)
    assertions.js      Deterministic checks (forbidden/required patterns, tool validation)
    judge.js           Gemini-as-judge for semantic evaluation
    agent.js           Lightweight Gemini function-calling agent loop
    reporter.js        Console + JSON output
  cases/
    <category>/        One .eval.js file per case; category is the directory name
```

The agent loop in `agent.js` loads the server's system prompt from
`prompts/system-prompt.md`, gets tool schemas from the MCP harness, and runs a
Gemini function-calling conversation loop until the model produces a final text
response.

## Eval file format

Each eval case is a JavaScript file at `cases/<category>/<id>.eval.js` that default-exports a single object. The full spec — every field, validation rules, and patterns for sharing rubrics across cases — is in [`docs/evals/format.md`](../../docs/evals/format.md). A copyable starter is at [`TEMPLATE.eval.js`](./TEMPLATE.eval.js).

Example:

```js
export default {
  id: 'm01',
  priority: 'P1',
  tags: ['dlp', 'create'],
  scenario: 'healthy',
  expectedTools: ['list_org_units', 'create_chrome_dlp_rule'],
  forbiddenPatterns: ['re:policies/\\w+', 're:fakeOUId\\d+'],
  requiredPatterns: ['warn'],
  prompt: `Create a DLP rule that warns users when they try to upload files
containing credit card numbers. Apply it to the root organizational unit.`,
  goldenResponse: `Agent should identify the root OU, then create a DLP rule
with warn action for file upload trigger with a content condition for credit
card patterns. Should confirm the rule was created successfully.`,
  judgeInstructions: `Verify the agent actually created the rule (tool was
called), not just described how to create one.`,
}
```

The category is the parent directory name; there is no `category` field on the case object.

## Grading: two layers

### Layer 1: Deterministic checks

These run first, are instant, and produce binary pass/fail results with no LLM
involvement.

**Forbidden pattern matching** checks that the agent's response text does not
contain any forbidden strings. Patterns are plain substring matches by default
(case-insensitive). Prefix with `re:` for regex:

```yaml
forbidden_patterns:
  - search_content # substring match
  - "re:policies/fake\\w+" # regex match
  - "re:all_content\\.matches_" # regex match
```

Each eval's `forbidden_patterns` are merged with the global list from
`global.yaml`, so you don't need to repeat tool names in every eval file. If a
forbidden pattern appears anywhere in the response, the eval fails immediately
regardless of the judge verdict.

**Required pattern matching** is the inverse -- the response must contain these
strings. Use sparingly and only for things with a canonical form: proper nouns
(`"Chrome Enterprise Premium"`), specific numbers (`"$6"`), exact URLs
(`"chrome://policy"`). For paraphrasable concepts ("the agent should mention
audit mode is silent"), use the judge instead.

**Expected tool validation** checks that every tool listed in `expected_tools`
was actually called by the agent. This catches a common failure mode: the agent
_describes_ what it would do instead of actually doing it. Tool checks are
skipped in `--dry-run` mode, since no agent runs and there are no actual tool
calls to validate.

### Layer 2: LLM-as-judge (Gemini)

After deterministic checks pass, the agent's response is sent to Gemini along
with the golden response and the judge rubric. The judge returns PASS/FAIL with
a one-sentence reasoning.

The default rubric (from `global.yaml`) evaluates:

1. **Core fact coverage** -- Does the response cover the primary technical facts
   from the golden response? Proactive troubleshooting (offering to check,
   asking for clarification) counts as coverage. Additional accurate info is
   encouraged.
2. **Hallucination & contradiction** -- Incorrect diagnostic steps or denying
   that a feature exists = FAIL.
3. **Tool name leakage** -- Naming internal tools in the user-facing response =
   FAIL. (This is also caught deterministically, but the judge provides a second
   layer.)
4. **Internal identifier leakage** -- Raw policy resource names, CEL
   expressions, API schema keys, or enum values appearing in the response =
   FAIL.

Per-eval `## Judge Instructions` override or extend this rubric for cases that
need specialized evaluation (e.g., "verify the agent actually created the rule,
not just described how").

### How the layers combine

```text
deterministic FAIL + judge PASS = FAIL  (leaked internal data but gave good answer)
deterministic PASS + judge FAIL = FAIL  (clean output but wrong/incomplete answer)
deterministic PASS + judge PASS = PASS
```

Both verdicts are recorded in the output so you can see _why_ something failed.

## Forbidden patterns

The agent should present results in user-friendly terms, never exposing internal
API plumbing. The `global.yaml` file defines forbidden patterns across seven
categories:

### MCP tool names

The internal tool names, such as `search_content` and `create_chrome_dlp_rule`,
must never appear in user-facing text. The agent should say "I checked your DLP
rules" not "I called `list_dlp_rules`."

### Chrome trigger API strings

Internal trigger identifiers like `google.workspace.chrome.file.v1.upload`. The
agent should say "file uploads", not the API string.

### Chrome policy schema names

Schema keys like `chrome.users.OnFileAttachedConnectorPolicy`. The agent should
say "Upload content analysis connector", not the schema key.

### Service provider enum values

API enum values like `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CHROME_ENTERPRISE_PREMIUM` or
`DEFAULT_ACTION_ALLOW`. The agent should say "Chrome Enterprise Premium" or
"allow."

### Cloud Identity setting types

Internal type identifiers like `settings/rule.dlp` or
`settings/detector.url_list`.

### API field names

Internal action keys like `blockContent`, `warnUser`, `auditOnly`,
`delayDeliveryUntilVerdict`. The agent should say "block", "warn", "audit."

### CEL expression syntax

Common Expression Language patterns like `all_content.contains(...)` or
`body.matches_word_list(...)`. These are internal condition representations that
users should never see.

Per-eval forbidden patterns (in frontmatter) add to this global list. For
mutation evals that touch the fake API, you'll typically add patterns for fake
resource IDs (`re:policies/fake\\w+`, `re:fakeOUId\\d+`).

## Eval categories

### `knowledge/` -- Factual Q&A

The agent answers a question about Chrome Enterprise Premium using the
`search_content` tool (knowledge base lookup). Graded on factual accuracy
against the golden response. No tool calls besides `search_content`.

Examples: "What is CEP?", "How much does it cost?", "How do I deploy Chrome?"

### `inspection/` -- Read-only diagnostics

The agent proactively calls read-only tools to inspect the user's environment
and report findings. Tests tool selection (did it call the right tools?) and
synthesis (did it summarize findings usefully?).

Examples: "Are my users protected?", "Run a health check", "What browser
versions are deployed?"

### `troubleshooting/` -- Multi-step investigation

The agent investigates a reported problem by calling multiple tools, correlating
findings, and producing a diagnosis. Tests reasoning across tool outputs.

Examples: "My DLP rule isn't working", "Users see scan delays", "Splunk
dashboard is empty"

### `mutation/` -- Create/delete resources

The agent makes changes: creating DLP rules, deleting detectors, etc. These
evals have the strictest forbidden evidence requirements because the agent's
confirmation message must describe what was done without leaking resource IDs,
CEL syntax, or API internals.

Examples: "Create a DLP rule that warns on credit card uploads", "Delete the
Block test123.com rule"

### `discovery/` -- List resources

The agent enumerates resources (org units, detectors, etc.) and presents them
clearly. Tests completeness and formatting.

Examples: "What's my customer ID?", "Show me all content detectors"

## Running evals

The four npm scripts cover the common workflows:

```bash
npm run eval              # all evals
npm run eval:knowledge    # knowledge category only
npm run eval:agentic      # all non-knowledge categories
npm run eval:full         # 3 runs per eval, JSON output
```

For one-off filtering, invoke the runner directly:

```bash
node test/evals/run.js --id m01           # single eval
node test/evals/run.js --tags dlp,create  # by tag
node test/evals/run.js --output out.json  # CI: JSON + exit code
```

The runner accepts more flags (`--runs`, `--concurrency`, `--delay`,
`--verbose`, `--no-judge`, `--dry-run`); see the usage block at the top of
[`run.js`](./run.js).

| `GEMINI_API_KEY`                 | **Required.** Gemini API key for both the agent and the judge.                                                                                    | --      |

| `EXPERIMENT_DELETE_TOOL_ENABLED` | Registers the delete-tool experiment. The runner defaults this to `true` so cases like `m03` test real agent judgment. Set to `false` to disable. | `true`  |

### Output

**Console** (default): clean summary table with per-eval pass/fail, timing, and
failure reasons. Category-level breakdown at the end.

**JSON** (`--output <path>`): structured results file with per-eval details
including deterministic check results, judge verdict + reasoning, tool calls,
response text, and timing. CI systems can parse this for reporting.

**Exit code**: 0 if all evals pass, 1 if any fail.

## Drift detection

The GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/agent-evals.yml`
runs the eval suite on a daily schedule (11:00 UTC) and on manual dispatch.
After each run completes, the full set of results is written to
`results/eval-latest.json` and uploaded as a workflow artifact.

Regressions are detected by `test/evals/diff.js`, which compares the latest
results against the checked-in baseline at `test/evals/baseline.json`. The
script exits with status code 1 when the overall pass rate has fallen by
more than 5%; the threshold is configurable through the `--threshold` flag.

When a regression is reported, an issue titled `Eval drift detected` is
opened under the `auto:evals` label. If such an issue is already open, a new
comment is appended to it instead. The workflow run itself is then marked as
failed.

When transient errors account for more than 20% of cases, the run is
classified as INCONCLUSIVE and the diff step is skipped. This prevents a
flaky upstream API from being mistaken for a real regression.

You can run the same diff locally:

```bash
node test/evals/diff.js test/evals/baseline.json results/eval-latest.json
```

### Updating the baseline

Refresh the baseline whenever the pass rate on `main` has been deliberately
improved — for example, after a system-prompt change or after new evals have
been added to the suite. The procedure is to download the artifact from a
green workflow run on `main`, copy `eval-latest.json` over the existing
baseline file, and commit the result:

```bash
gh run download <RUN_ID> --repo google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp --dir /tmp/eval-artifact
cp /tmp/eval-artifact/eval-results/eval-latest.json test/evals/baseline.json
```

Once the updated baseline is on `main`, subsequent scheduled and manually
dispatched runs are compared against it.

## Writing new evals

1. Copy `test/evals/TEMPLATE.eval.js` to `cases/<category>/<id>.eval.js`. The category is the parent directory name.
2. Set `id` to a value that's unique across the suite. Both short codes (`m04`) and descriptive snake_case (`list_dlp_rules__no_rules`) are accepted; match whichever a sibling case in the same directory uses.
3. Set `prompt` (or `promptName`) and `goldenResponse`. Add `expectedTools`, `scenario`, `tags`, and `judgeInstructions` as needed.
4. For mutation cases, add `'re:policies/\\w+'` to `forbiddenPatterns` to catch resource ID leaks.
5. Run `npm run eval -- --id <your-id>` to verify the case loads, scenario applies, and the judge passes.

See [`docs/evals/format.md`](../../docs/evals/format.md) for the full field reference.

### Tips

- Golden responses don't need to be word-for-word templates. Describe the key facts and behaviors the response should exhibit. The judge evaluates semantic equivalence, not exact match.
- The `expectedTools` check is strict: every listed tool must be called. Don't list tools that the agent _might_ call — list tools it _should_ call.
- If the eval tests a tool that modifies state, the fake server resets between evals so ordering doesn't matter.

## Server integration

The eval agent runs against the actual server code:

- System prompt from `prompts/system-prompt.md`
- Tool schemas from `tools/index.js` via the MCP SDK's `client.listTools()`
- Tool execution through the in-memory MCP transport
- Fake API backend in `test/helpers/fake-api-server.js` (Express, in-process)

This means evals catch regressions in the system prompt, tool descriptions, tool
implementations, and response formatting.
