  prompt: 'How is my event reporting connector configured for the Root OU?',
  goldenResponse:
    'The Event Reporting connector is active but has no security events selected for reporting. This means your organization is not receiving any security telemetry. Specifically, all core events (Content transfer, Malware transfer, etc.) are missing. I strongly recommend enabling these events in the Admin Console.',
  judgeInstructions:
    'Pass if the agent issues a critical warning indicating that no events are being reported and mentions the missing core telemetry.',
