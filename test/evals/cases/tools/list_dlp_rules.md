## Prompt

What are the API resource names for my configured rules?

## Golden Response

The resource names are:
- **Block sensitive file uploads**: `policies/dlpBlock1`
- **Watermark confidential documents**: `policies/dlpWatermark1`
- **Audit pastes to generative AI sites**: `policies/dlpAuditGenAI`
- **Warn before uploading PII**: `policies/dlpWarnPII`

## Judge Instructions

The agent must accurately extract the technical resource names from the tool's output. This verifies it can read the "Resource names for API operations" section of the tool's response.
