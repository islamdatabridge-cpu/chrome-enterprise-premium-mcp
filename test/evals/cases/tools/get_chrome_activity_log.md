## Prompt

Have there been any recent data transfer violations or unscanned files?

## Golden Response

Yes, there was a CONTENT_UNSCANNED event — a file download by alex@cep-netnew.cc
was not scanned by the DLP engine. This typically means the file was
password-protected, too large, or the download connector wasn't configured to
scan it.

## Judge Instructions

The agent must identify the CONTENT_UNSCANNED event and the associated user.
Mentioning the specific filename or explaining the significance is a plus but not strictly required as long as the agent reports the unscanned event correctly.

## Prompt

Review recent Chrome security events. Are there any DLP violations or content
scanning issues I should know about?

## Golden Response

Agent should report 5 events across 3 users: two blocks (alice uploading payroll
and SSN files to external sites), one warn (bob uploading a customer list), one
unscanned file (carol downloading an encrypted archive), and one audit event
(bob pasting into ChatGPT). The agent should summarize patterns — alice has
repeat block violations on sensitive uploads, the encrypted archive could not be
scanned, and the GenAI paste was audit-only.

## Judge Instructions

The agent must report the events and provide some level of summary or
observation beyond a raw list. Acceptable synthesis includes: grouping by user
or event type, noting repeat violations, flagging the unscanned file, or
recommending follow-up actions. A response that merely lists timestamps and
event names with no commentary is a FAIL, but any reasonable attempt at
summarization should PASS.
