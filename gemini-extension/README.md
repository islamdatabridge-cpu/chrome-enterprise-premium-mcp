# gemini-extension

`GEMINI.md` is the grounding context [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
prepends to every agent session when a user installs this repo as an
extension. It sets the agent's persona, the operating protocol it
follows, and the technical anchors (pricing, IAM roles, deployment
commands) we want it to cite when answering CEP questions.

The extension manifest at the repo root
([`gemini-extension.json`](../gemini-extension.json)) points at this
file, declares the OAuth scopes the agent requests on first run, and
tells Gemini CLI to launch `mcp-server.js` as the MCP backend.
