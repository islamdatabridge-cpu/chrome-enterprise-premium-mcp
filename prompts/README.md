# MCP Prompts

The Chrome Enterprise Premium MCP server provides a set of prompts to guide the
agent through complex diagnostic and optimization workflows.

## Structure

- `index.js` — Registers all prompts with the server.
- `definitions/` — One file per prompt, each exporting a
  `registerXxxPrompt(server)` function.
- `system-prompt.md` — The agent's behavioral instructions, injected into the
  first tool response by `tools/utils/wrapper.js`. The `cep:expert` prompt
  re-injects the same content and serves as a manual override when a client
  drops context mid-conversation.

## Current prompts

| Name           | File          | Description                                                                |
| :------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cep:health`   | `health.js`   | Health check of the Chrome Enterprise environment.                         |
| `cep:optimize` | `optimize.js` | Rule-by-rule review with tuning, enforcement, and cleanup recommendations. |
| `cep:expert`   | `expert.js`   | Loads the full expert persona from `system-prompt.md`.                     |

## Shared diagnostic rules (`definitions/shared.js`)

The `SHARED_DIAGNOSTIC_RULES` constant contains markdown formatting instructions
(status table format, severity tiers, tone) appended to the `cep:health`
prompt so diagnostic output stays consistent.

## Adding a new prompt

1. Create `definitions/new_prompt.js` exporting a `registerNewPrompt(server)`
   function.
2. Call `server.registerPrompt(name, schema, handler)` where the handler returns
   a `messages` array.
3. Import and call the register function in `index.js`.
