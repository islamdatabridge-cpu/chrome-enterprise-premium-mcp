# Configuration

You configure the server with environment variables. How you set them depends on the transport mode.

## MCP client (stdio mode)

Add the variables to the `env` block of your MCP client's settings file. The client injects them into the server's environment on startup.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "GCP_STDIO": "true",
        "GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT": "your-project-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Standalone (HTTP mode)

You can pass variables inline on the command line or load them from a `.env` file in your working directory. For the full set of options, see [`.env.example`](../.env.example).

```bash
PORT=8080 GCP_STDIO=false npx -y @google/chrome-enterprise-premium-mcp@latest
```

## Key variables

| Variable                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Default |

| `LOG_LEVEL`                  | Verbosity. One of `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`.                                                                                                                                                                                                | `info`  |
| `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE`        | When set in HTTP mode, every inbound request must carry an `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` whose `aud` claim is in this value (comma-separated for multiple). When unset, ID-token verification is off and the server prints a startup warning. | -       |

> [!NOTE]
> When `GCP_STDIO=false` and `PORT` is unset or `0`, the server binds to a random available port. The actual port is logged at startup, for example: `Chrome Enterprise Premium MCP server listening on port X`.

## Authenticate to Google APIs

`lib/util/auth.js#getAuthClient` resolves credentials in this priority order: a bearer header on the request, Application Default Credentials, then the OAuth token cache. Pick a setup based on your environment. For situational guidance by deployment shape, see the [Which auth path should I use?](faq.md#which-auth-path-should-i-use) FAQ entry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The HTTP-mode default has no network-layer authentication. Bind the listener to a trusted interface only, or set `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE` (HTTP mode only) for per-request ID-token verification.

### Inbound bearer ID-token verification (HTTP mode)

For HTTP-mode deployments behind an OAuth-bearing caller, such as Vertex AI Agent Engine, set `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE` to the OAuth client ID whose ID-token issuance is allowed for this server. With it set, every inbound request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>`, and the server checks the token's `aud` claim against `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE`. Failures return `401 Unauthorized` ahead of any forward to Google. When `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE` is unset, the check is off and the server prints a startup warning.
