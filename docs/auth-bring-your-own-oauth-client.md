# Bring your own OAuth client

To run `mcp auth login`, you need a Google OAuth client. Until Google provisions a managed client for this project, you must supply your own. Set `CEP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `CEP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment to point at a Desktop OAuth client that you create in your Google Cloud project.

When you log in, the CLI writes an access token to `~/.config/cep-mcp/tokens.json` with file mode `0600`. The cache contains the access token only—no refresh token—and the access token expires after about an hour.

## Create a Desktop OAuth client

Follow these steps to create a Desktop OAuth client and copy its credentials:

1. Open the [Google Cloud console Clients page](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients).
2. Click **Create client**.
3. In the **Application type** menu, select **Desktop app**.
4. In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name.
5. Click **Create**.
6. From the **OAuth client created** dialog, copy the client ID and the client secret.

## Sign in for the first time

Follow these steps to authenticate the CLI with the OAuth client you created:

1. Export the credentials in your shell. Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with the values you copied:

   ```bash
   export CEP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="CLIENT_ID"
   export CEP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="CLIENT_SECRET"
   ```

2. Run `mcp auth login`.
3. Approve consent in the browser that the CLI opens.
4. Verify the cache by running `mcp auth-status`.

## Sign in from a host without a browser

Use this path for continuous integration runners, SSH sessions, and containers without a local browser.

Follow these steps to sign in by pasting the redirect URL from a different machine:

1. Run `mcp auth login`. The CLI prints a consent URL to standard error.
2. Copy the consent URL.
3. Open the URL in a browser on a machine that has one, such as your laptop.
4. Approve consent on the Google consent screen.
5. Copy the full redirect URL from the browser address bar, including the `code=` parameter.
6. Paste the redirect URL at the CLI's stdin prompt.

**Note:** After approval, the browser fetches `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?code=...` and shows "connection refused" or 404. This is expected; the loopback address points to the host running the CLI, not the host with the browser. The redirect URL with the `code=` parameter is in the address bar regardless.

## Scopes

When you log in, the CLI requests every scope listed in `lib/constants.js#OAUTH_SCOPES`. That set is `SCOPES` minus `cloud-platform`, so the consent screen shows the narrower per-API scopes the server actually uses. To see which scopes the cached token actually granted, run `mcp auth-status`.

## Refresh expired tokens

The access token expires after about an hour. The cache holds no refresh token, so the next Google API call returns `401 Unauthorized`. Run `mcp auth login` again to mint a new access token.
