# Cloud Run and Gemini Enterprise deployment

For hosted deployments, OAuth is the recommended authentication path. A service account with domain-wide delegation is the alternative when OAuth is not viable; the service account setup is at the end of this page.

## Recommended: OAuth bearer per request

OAuth bearer per request has two parts.

The first part is the OAuth-handling layer. Vertex AI Agent Engine handles OAuth consent for you. You register your OAuth client with Agent Engine; the registered redirect URI is `https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/oauth-redirect`. Agent Engine receives the authorization code, exchanges it for tokens, and forwards the user's access token (or ID token) on every tool-call request to your MCP server.

The second part is inbound verification. In HTTP mode, set `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE` to the OAuth client ID you registered. The server then checks every inbound request's `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` against that audience before forwarding to Google. Failures return `401 Unauthorized`. For configuration detail, see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#authenticate-to-google-apis).

### Cloud Run setup sketch

```bash
gcloud run deploy cep-mcp \
  --source=. \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --no-allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars=GCP_STDIO=false,CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE=YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` with the client ID of the OAuth client you registered with Agent Engine.

Register the OAuth client with Vertex AI Agent Engine through the Agent Engine console or its CLI. The exact `create-auth` invocation lives in the Agent Engine documentation. For this MCP server, the registration needs the OAuth client ID, the OAuth client secret, Google's standard authorization and token URIs, and a scope list. The scope list is `OAUTH_SCOPES` from `lib/constants.js`, which is the full `SCOPES` set minus `cloud-platform`.

A reference walkthrough of an end-to-end ADK agent on Vertex AI Agent Engine with OAuth is the third-party blog post [Powering up your agent in production with ADK, OAuth, and Gemini Enterprise](https://fmind.medium.com/powering-up-your-agent-in-production-with-adk-oauth-and-gemini-enterprise-a52b0716fcba).

## Alternative: service account with domain-wide delegation

For deployments where Agent Engine is unavailable or OAuth consent is not viable, a service account with domain-wide delegation is the alternative. The setup matches the [FAQ entry on service accounts](faq.md#can-i-use-a-service-account-instead-of-user-credentials). On Cloud Run, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path inside the container where the JSON key file is mounted.

> [!CAUTION]
> A service account with domain-wide delegation grants the server impersonation rights for any user in the domain for the granted scopes. The trust grant is broader than per-user OAuth. Choose the OAuth path when feasible.

## Status

The MCP server's bearer pass-through and ID-token verification are ready in this codebase. Vertex AI Agent Engine's `create-auth` API is in private preview, so production wiring depends on whether the maintainer has access. Until Agent Engine reaches general availability, the loopback OAuth flow (`mcp auth login`) is the workstation-only equivalent and is not a drop-in for hosted deployments.
