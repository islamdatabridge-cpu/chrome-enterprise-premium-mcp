# FAQ

## Do I need a Chrome Enterprise Premium license?

Yes. DLP rules, content detectors, Chrome connectors, and threat protection
are CEP features. They require an active Chrome Enterprise Premium license
[assigned to the relevant users](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise-premium/docs/overview).
Without it, most tools will return permission errors. A 60-day free trial is
available from the Admin Console or Cloud Console.

## Which Google Workspace edition do I need?

Chrome Enterprise Premium is a paid add-on available with any Google
Workspace edition. Chrome Enterprise Core (free) provides policy management
for over 300 policies but does not include DLP, threat protection, or
Context-Aware Access. See
[Chrome Enterprise Premium pricing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise-premium/docs/overview)
for current rates.

## Which auth path should I use?

Three paths, by environment:

- **Workstation, gcloud installed, you're the Cloud admin:** ADC. Run
  `gcloud auth application-default login` per the
  [Quick Start](../README.md#1-authenticate-with-google-cloud).
- **Workstation, no gcloud or not the Cloud admin:** OAuth flow. Run
  `mcp auth login`. Setup walkthrough at
  [`docs/auth-bring-your-own-oauth-client.md`](auth-bring-your-own-oauth-client.md).
- **Hosted (Cloud Run, Vertex AI Agent Engine, etc.):** OAuth bearer
  on each request. The caller sets `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>`;
  the server verifies via `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE` (see
  [`docs/configuration.md`](configuration.md#inbound-bearer-id-token-verification-http-mode)).
  SA + DWD is the alternative (see the next entry); for new hosted
  deployments, OAuth is preferred because SA + DWD grants the server
  impersonation rights for any user in the domain.

## Can I use a service account instead of user credentials?

Yes, but the service account must have
[domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority)
configured in the Admin Console with the required scopes. Set
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to the key file.

## Why do I see "Retrying in 15s..." on first use?

Newly enabled APIs take a few minutes to propagate. The server retries
automatically. Normal on first run; should resolve within a minute or two.

## How do I enable experimental features?

Some tools (e.g., deletion of DLP rules and detectors) are gated behind
feature flags and disabled by default. Enable them with `EXPERIMENT_`-prefixed
environment variables:

```bash
EXPERIMENT_DELETE_TOOL_ENABLED=true npm start
```

See [`lib/util/feature_flags.js`](../lib/util/feature_flags.js) for the full
list.
