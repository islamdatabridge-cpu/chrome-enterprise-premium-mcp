# FAQ

## Do I need a Chrome Enterprise Premium license?

Yes, you need an active Chrome Enterprise Premium license assigned to the relevant users. DLP rules, content detectors, Chrome connectors, and threat protection are all Chrome Enterprise Premium features. Without the license, most tools return permission errors. A 60-day trial is available; see the [Chrome Enterprise Premium overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise-premium/docs/overview) for the trial and license details.

## Which Google Workspace edition do I need?

Chrome Enterprise Premium is a paid add-on available with any Google Workspace edition. Chrome Enterprise Core, which is included with Google Cloud at no additional cost, provides policy management for over 300 Chrome policies but does not include DLP, threat protection, or Context-Aware Access. For pricing details, see the [Chrome Enterprise Premium overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise-premium/docs/overview).

## Which auth path should I use?

The right path depends on your environment.

- **Workstation, gcloud installed, you are a Google Cloud admin for the project:** Application Default Credentials. Run `gcloud auth application-default login` per the [Quick Start](../README.md#1-authenticate-with-google-cloud).
- **Workstation, no gcloud or you are not a Google Cloud admin:** OAuth login. Run `mcp auth login`. For the setup walkthrough, see [`auth-bring-your-own-oauth-client.md`](auth-bring-your-own-oauth-client.md).
- **Hosted on Cloud Run, Vertex AI Agent Engine, or a similar managed environment:** OAuth bearer per request. The caller sets `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` and the server verifies the token's `aud` claim against `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE`. A service account with domain-wide delegation is the alternative. OAuth is preferred for hosted deployments because a service account with domain-wide delegation grants the server impersonation rights for any user in the domain.

For the per-mechanism technical reference (transport, credential source, setup walkthrough), see the [authentication matrix](configuration.md#authenticate-to-google-apis) in `configuration.md`.

## Can I use a service account instead of user credentials?

Yes. The service account must have [domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) configured in the Admin Console with the required scopes. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the service account key file.

## Why do I see "Retrying in 15s..." on the first call?

Newly enabled APIs take a few minutes to propagate. The server retries `PERMISSION_DENIED` (gRPC code 7) up to seven times automatically; the first retry waits 15 seconds. The behavior is normal on first run and resolves within a minute or two.

## How do I enable experimental features?

Some tools, such as deletion of DLP rules and detectors, are gated behind feature flags and disabled by default. Enable them with `EXPERIMENT_`-prefixed environment variables.

```bash
EXPERIMENT_DELETE_TOOL_ENABLED=true npm start
```

For the full list of feature flags, see [`lib/util/feature_flags.js`](../lib/util/feature_flags.js).
