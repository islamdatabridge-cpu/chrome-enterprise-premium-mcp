# lib/api

Google Cloud and Workspace API clients. Every API has a single client
wrapper. Tools depend on these clients directly; for integration tests,
we redirect them to an in-process fake HTTP server without changing tool
code.

## Client pattern

Every API has a single file:

- `foo_client.js`: production implementation. Authenticates through ADC and
  calls the live Google API. Each method also accepts a bearer token,
  which when supplied takes the place of ADC.

For tests, we instantiate the same `*Client` class and redirect it at the
fake API server in `test/helpers/fake-api-server.js`. The factory in
`test/helpers/integration/tools/client_factory.js` does the wiring:

```js
// Real backend (production / postsubmit): no args, uses ADC.
new AdminSdkClient()

// Fake backend (presubmit): same class, redirected through rootUrl + a fake
// auth provider that short-circuits getAuthClient().
new AdminSdkClient({ rootUrl, auth: fakeAuth })
```

`mcp-server.js` uses the same trick: when `GOOGLE_API_ROOT_URL` is set, it
passes `rootUrl` into each client.

## API domains

| Domain            | Client File                   | APIs used                                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Admin SDK         | `admin_sdk_client.js`         | Directory (org units, customer ID), Reports (activity logs), Licensing (CEP license checks) |
| Chrome Management | `chrome_management_client.js` | Browser version counts, customer profiles                                                   |
| Chrome Policy     | `chrome_policy_client.js`     | Connector policies, extension install policies                                              |
| Cloud Identity    | `cloud_identity_client.js`    | DLP rules, detectors (CRUD)                                                                 |
| Service Usage     | `service_usage_client.js`     | API enablement checks                                                                       |

## Adding a new API client

1. Create `new_client.js` that implements the client using `googleapis`
   or `@google-cloud/*`. Take an optional `apiOptions` argument and pass it
   through to your client constructor so `rootUrl` and `auth` overrides work.
2. Wire the new client into `mcp-server.js` (both the
   `GOOGLE_API_ROOT_URL`-set and unset branches construct the same
   clients).
3. Add the new client to `getApiClients()` in
   `test/helpers/integration/tools/client_factory.js`. Mirror the existing
   pattern: instantiate with no args for the `real` branch, and with
   `{ rootUrl, auth: fakeAuth }` for the `fake` branch.
4. Add HTTP handlers for the new API to `test/helpers/fake-api-server.js` so
   the fake backend can serve the requests your client will make.
