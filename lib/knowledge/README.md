# lib/knowledge

Built-in Chrome Enterprise Premium knowledge base. The `search_content` tool
searches these articles by keyword; `get_document` returns an article's full
text by ID. The loader reads articles lazily on the first tool call and
caches them in memory for the rest of the session.

## Article format

Each file is a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: 'Human-readable title'
summary: 'One-line summary returned by search_content results'
articleId: 4
kind: curated
url: 'https://support.google.com/...'
---
# Article body

Full content returned by get_document.
```

**File naming:** `{articleId}-{slug}.md`. The numeric prefix is the `articleId`
used by `get_document`.

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field       | Required | Description                                                                              |
| :---------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`     | Yes      | Display title in search results                                                          |
| `summary`   | Yes      | Brief description returned alongside search hits                                         |
| `articleId` | Yes      | Numeric ID for `get_document` lookup                                                     |
| `kind`      | No       | Content type (`curated`, `helpcenter`, `cloud-docs`, `policies`). Defaults to `curated`. |
| `url`       | No       | Link to the canonical source document                                                    |

## Special article: 0-agent-capabilities.md

Article 0 is not just searchable — it is injected alongside the system prompt on
the agent's first tool call (via `tools/utils/wrapper.js`). It defines what the
agent can and cannot do, which grounds the agent's behavior from the first
interaction.

## Adding a new article

Create a `.md` file with the next available `articleId`, add YAML frontmatter,
and write the content. No code changes are needed — the loader discovers files
from this directory at runtime.
