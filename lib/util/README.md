Cross-cutting helpers the API layer and tools share: authentication,
logging, retry, GCP detection, CEL validation, and feature flags.

## Files by function

**Auth**

- `auth.js` — `getAuthClient()` returns an authenticated client using
  Application Default Credentials (ADC), or wraps a supplied bearer when
  one is passed. Also exports `ensureADCCredentials()`.
- `auth-error.js` — Generates descriptive error messages for auth failures
  (missing credentials, insufficient scopes, quota project not set). Detects
  `gcloud` installation and suggests fix commands.
- `google-auth-provider.js` — Production auth provider class. Wraps
  `getAuthClient` for use by real API clients.

**API plumbing**

- `api-client.js` — Factory function that creates authenticated `googleapis`
  service clients.
- `helpers.js` — `callWithRetry()` for API calls with exponential backoff on
  `PERMISSION_DENIED`. `handleApiError()` for structured error logging and
  re-throwing.

**DLP domain constants**

- `chrome_dlp_constants.js` — Chrome DLP trigger types, action types, CEL
  grammar reference, content types, web categories, and validation constraints.
  Large reference file used by the CEL validator and tool descriptions.
- `cel_validator.js` — Offline validation of CEL conditions against the Chrome
  DLP grammar. Checks parentheses, method names, content types, trigger
  compatibility, and action parameters before submitting rules to the API.

**Infrastructure**

- `logger.js` — Leveled logger (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR). Routes all output to
  stderr in stdio mode so stdout stays clean for MCP protocol messages.
- `gcp.js` — GCP metadata server utilities. `checkGCP()` detects the runtime
  environment; `ensureApisEnabled()` checks and enables required APIs.
- `feature_flags.js` — Reads `EXPERIMENT_`-prefixed environment variables
  to enable experimental tools. Today the delete tools sit behind
  `EXPERIMENT_DELETE_TOOL_ENABLED`.
