Cross-cutting helpers the API layer and tools share: authentication,
logging, retry, GCP detection, CEL validation, and feature flags.

## Files by function

**Auth**

- `auth.js`: `getAuthClient(scopes, authToken)`. Three credential
  sources, in priority order:
  1. bearer header on the request,
  2. Application Default Credentials,
  3. cached OAuth token (fires only when ADC throws).

  Also exports `ensureADCCredentials()`.

- `auth-error.js`: error-message formatter for auth failures (missing
  credentials, insufficient scopes, quota project not set). Includes
  `gcloud`-installation detection and fix-command suggestions.

- `auth_messages.js`: pure formatters for the startup banner. The
  `CredentialProbe` typedef is the shared shape across credential
  factories (ADC, OAuth-flow, bearer); `buildScopesField` consumes it.

- `google-auth-provider.js`: production auth provider class. Wraps
  `getAuthClient` for use by real API clients.

**Credential factories** (`credential/`)

- `adc.js`: `adcCredential()`. Probe sequence: ADC, then tokeninfo,
  then scope diff against the required set.

- `oauth_flow.js`: `oauthFlowCredential()`. Managed-OAuth login flow
  through `runLoginFlow()` (loopback callback or headless paste-back) and
  a probe over the cached token. Default scopes: `OAUTH_SCOPES` (no
  `cloud-platform`).

- `token_cache.js`: `TokenCache`. Read-write access on a path-injected
  file with mode 0600. Refresh tokens are stripped.

- `loopback_server.js`: random-port `127.0.0.1` HTTP server for the
  OAuth callback.

- `oauth_client_config.js`: resolves OAuth client config (managed
  bundled placeholder, BYO env vars, or future custom modes).

- `cli_commands.js`: `runAuthStatusCommand` and `runLoginCommand` for
  the `mcp auth-status` and `mcp auth login` CLI subcommands.

- `jwt_verifier.js`: `verifyIdToken` plus `parseExpectedAudience`. Used
  by `mcp-server.js` middleware in HTTP mode when `CEP_BEARER_AUDIENCE`
  is set.

**API plumbing**

- `api-client.js` — Factory function that creates authenticated `googleapis`
  service clients.
- `helpers.js` — `callWithRetry()` for API calls with exponential backoff on
  `PERMISSION_DENIED`. `handleApiError()` for structured error logging and
  re-throwing.

**DLP domain constants**

- `chrome_dlp_constants.js` — Chrome DLP trigger types, action types, CEL
  grammar reference, content types, web categories, and validation constraints.
  Large reference file used by the CEL validator and tool descriptions.
- `cel_validator.js` — Offline validation of CEL conditions against the Chrome
  DLP grammar. Checks parentheses, method names, content types, trigger
  compatibility, and action parameters before submitting rules to the API.

**Infrastructure**

- `logger.js` — Leveled logger (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR). Routes all output to
  stderr in stdio mode so stdout stays clean for MCP protocol messages.
- `gcp.js` — GCP metadata server utilities. `checkGCP()` detects the runtime
  environment; `ensureApisEnabled()` checks and enables required APIs.
- `feature_flags.js` — Reads `EXPERIMENT_`-prefixed environment variables
  to enable experimental tools. Today the delete tools sit behind
  `EXPERIMENT_DELETE_TOOL_ENABLED`.
